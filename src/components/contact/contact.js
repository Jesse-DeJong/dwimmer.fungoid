// Contact Form

// Internal take user name/email and freetext input and email it to email configured in admin, and/or store and access in admin area
// Also styled in ASCII fed to renderImage() to change the central 75%(?) into the contact form,
// Maybe have a text box appear over the grid rather than limit email contacts to a random screen size determined availability of characters (or reuse the input system from the download section and type in the ASCII grid slots have an inherently smaller cap like a twitter message if just a 'hey contact me' style is preferable to a lengthy custom message)
// redundantly provide email address directly in form
